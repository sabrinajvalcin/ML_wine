# ML_wine
I used Machine Learning Models to predict wine color

Raw data files:
- winequality-red.csv
- winequality-white.csv

My code:
- knn_anova.py : contains code for implementing knn algorithm on the dataset
- d_tree.py : contains code for implementing a decision tree

Other files:
- ml_presentation.mov : a screen recording of my presentation
- explore.py : visualize the data and features

The remainng files are graphs and images created by running the code
