Raw data files:
- winequality-red.csv
- winequality-white.csv

My code:
- knn_anova.py : contains code for implementing knn algorithm on the dataset
- d_tree.py : contains code for implementing a decision tree

Other files:
- explore.py : visualize the data and features
-wine.names : source of data
- The remainng files are graphs and images created by running the code
